# Minimal Computing - Rural Applications 
> Mozilla Science Global Sprint - Citizen Science - Minimal Computing - Rural Applications

## Introduction

Our project mission is to make computing universally accessible in the form of a robust, small, off-grid and open source computer based on Raspberry Pi and other readily available store-bought technologies.  

The parameters of the challenge are to make a raspberry pi based system that can be powered off of a 10Watt solar panel, two 12V 7.2AH batteries and run without sun for 10 hours.  This is likely impossible, but getting close will be an amazing achievement.  The product must be easy to use, easy to adapt, cheap and able to operate effectively in the broadest possible range of poor contexts.  The product must be accompanied by an online resource such as instructibles.com to enable broad participation in projects, adaptations and applications that will stretch and develop the technologyâ€™s potential.

## Contributers
Anyone is welcome to join in, there is room for programmers, designers, engineers, anthropologist, philosophers basically anyone who would like to get involved in bridging the digital devide.

## How to get invovled

> Becoming involved is easy.  The project presents five main technical challenges on the level of the technology.

1) The first is obtaining good data of energy consumption for the required peripherals and add-ons. Read more in the [Roadmap] (Roadmap) 

2) The second challenge is creating a cheap way of shutting the Raspberry Pi down safely when the battery is close to running out of electricity. Read more in the [Roadmap] (Roadmap) 

3) The third is designing a solar power solution that is cheap, minimal, upgradeable, and maintainable with very limited knowledge of solar power systems. Read more in the [Roadmap] (Roadmap) 

4) The fourth is to produce an adaptable enough case system for the final product.Read more in the [Roadmap] (Roadmap) 

5) The fifth challenge is developing a DIY type sharing website where users can post challenges and solutions stemming from projects in their communities/professional contexts.  Read more in the [Roadmap] (Roadmap) 

## Final Project timeline
The timeline for spesific interaction and brainstroming sessions for 2-3 June will be released on 31 May
