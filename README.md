# Minimal Computing - Rural Applications 
> Mozilla Science Global Sprint - Citizen Science - Minimal Computing - Rural Applications

## Introduction:

Our project mission is to make computing universally accessible in the form of a robust, small, off-grid and open source computer based on Raspberry Pi and other readily available store-bought technologies.  

The parameters of the challenge are to make a raspberry pi based system that can be powered off of a 10Watt solar panel, two 12V 7.2AH batteries and run without sun for 10 hours.  This is likely impossible, but getting close will be an amazing achievement.  The product must be easy to use, easy to adapt, cheap and able to operate effectively in the broadest possible range of poor contexts.  The product must be accompanied by an online resource such as instructibles.com to enable broad participation in projects, adaptations and applications that will stretch and develop the technologyâ€™s potential.

How to get invovled:

Becoming involved is easy.  The project presents five main technical challenges on the level of the technology.

1) The first is obtaining good data of energy consumption for the required peripherals and add-ons. Read more in the [Roadmap] (ruralcomputing/Roadmap) The technology will need to include a mouse, a keyboard, and a wi-fi solution.  We will need information on a broad range of peripherals and anyone with a pi and the required equipment can help by contributing data on energy consumption.  Please be sure to provide full product names and codes so that the data set remains clear.  This challenge includes identifying a possible monitor or an alternative workable visual solution, such as linking to a mobile phone.  This is likely to be one of the main variables determining the size and the cost of the required solar solution.  We want the monitor to be big enough to be able to read and produce documents comfortably, 10 inches is a reasonable goal to work towards. 

2) The second challenge is creating a cheap way of shutting the Raspberry Pi down safely when the battery is close to running out of electricity. 

3) The third is designing a solar power solution that is cheap, minimal, upgradeable, and maintainable with very limited knowledge of solar power systems. 

4) The fourth is to produce an adaptable enough case system for the final product.  This case must be attractive, small, and adaptive enough to be useful to those who want to add to or alter the technology to suit their local resources and goals.

5) The fifth challenge is developing a DIY type sharing website where users can post challenges and solutions stemming from projects in their communities/professional contexts.  This site is essential to attract more users and to build points of attachment between the technology and local objectives.  The site must be easy to use and suitable to the technology through which it will be accessed.  It must also be able to exist on a local network for contexts where there is no internet access but where a group of users can still work together on projects, share documents and discuss challenges and solutions.
